# Dual-Extruder-X4
Dual Extruder X4: Nothing like the last one.

From video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoTP-JLsL74&t=5s

"Redesigned from the ground up. It uses 2 Revo Vorons and 2 LGX Lites, one mirrored. 
The switching mechanism is optimized and compact. It uses a laser cut stainless steel backbone. Has direct nozzle Z-probing and it can even detect tool change faults.
I believe to have reached the peak of this mountain. It's the most compact it will ever be using mostly 3d printed parts. " - RobertGcode

The only 2 custom parts are laser cut 2mm stainless steel. 
This print head was designed to fit the specific coreXY motion system of the Cyberprintr.

# **Design Notes:**

Make sure to print the important parts from a stiff filament that doesn't creep, because the lift mechanism is under constant pressure.
I have 3d printed all parts from ezPC-CF from 3DXtech. 
Used a combination of standard and short M3 heat inserts from CNCKitchen.

**Lift Slider**

When you 3d print the lift slider, consider it as a consumable part. Must be replaced every 5000 to 10000 tool changes.
Unless you get it CNC-machined from metal.

**Experimental Design**

Advanced knowledge about every aspect of building 3d printers is required. 
I won't be providing any more in-depth documentation.
Firmware, config, macro and slicer settings will differ greatly from printer to printer.


**Screenshots**

The rest of the assembly and BOM should be easy to figure out from the CAD.
